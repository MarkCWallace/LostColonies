# Lost Colonies Rules
All of the things you need to know before you start playing

## How to use this Document

This rulebook is intended to provide the essential information you will need to participate in a Lost Colonies event.  
Getting Started contains the Lost Colonies safety and community standards; this is all the information you need *before* you start play.  We expect that all players will have read this material, and every player should expect that every other participant (player, staff, etc.) will conduct their behavior according to these standards. 

- Safety and Community Standards: these explain the fundamentals of our gameplay philosophy and the culture that we aspire to achieve and maintain here at Lost Colonies.
- Character Creation: this is a step-by-step guide to creating your unique character. This section explains the mechanical and roleplay components that go into your character, starting with Region, Ancestry, Background, and Guild. You will also select your character’s starting Attributes. These traits help define your character and their role in the colony. Once you have created your character, you will be ready to explore sections that describe the elements of gameplay.

Rulebook contains the core rules. These are the rules you are most likely to consult during the game.  Players are expected to be familiar with the rules that are relevant to their character.

- Combat: this section includes information about Wounds, Injuries, Scars, and Death, and explains our unique way of handling the bad stuff that can happen to a character.

References contains

- Reference: this is where we list many of the details that flesh out the world of Lost Colonies. This includes sample recipes for crafting and rituals, how to make mundane and magical items or effects, and a list of effects and skills which define all the things that characters can do or the effects they may be subject to.
- Out of Game Errata: This section explains NPC shift, camp cleanup, service points, and other rules and expectations that come with being part of the Lost Colonies player community.

This rulebook does **not** include:

- A comprehensive guide to roleplay or character acting, and gives only a brief overview of larping as a hobby, if you are interested in further resources or tips, there are many excellent resources available online
- We do not attempt to address all possible rules conflicts. While we have tried to create a simple, cooperative system, we cannot foresee all eventualities. If conflicts or confusion should arise, Marshals will determine an appropriate course of action, and will have final say in all decision-making.

These rules will continue to evolve; our rules system is designed to give players the freedom to invent new recipes, use skills in innovative ways, and even develop new skills through roleplay and storytelling. As such, players should expect that the list of available skills and their limitations will grow over time.  We will publish updates to the rules as needed.

# Combat

Combat can be one of the most exciting and rewarding parts of an event. But there are some rules to follow so that everyone can have a safe and enjoyable time.

## Base Weapon Damage
- All melee weapons deal 1 point of damage
- All guns deal 2 points of damage

The verbal calling of base weapon damage is optional. Any attacks that do something other than base weapon damage requires a verbal call along with it. What you need to say will be specified by the skill you are using.


## Special Damage

Sometimes an effect will deliver damage of a certain type, such as Fire damage from an exploding bomb or Water damage from a Ritualist’s wand. When delivering such an effect, you must call the amount of damage along with the type of damage delivered, such as “2 Fire” or “3 Water”. 


## Basic Combat Training

Every character understands how to defend themselves. In addition to using weapons and armor, every character has access to the Combat Familiarity skill for free. 

**Combat Familiarity**
Reqs: Untrained
All characters have access to this skill
Combat Grit: [Always] You may spend 1 Grit to call a Combat Maneuver that you have access to.
Oomph: You gain access to the +1 Damage Combat Maneuver
Out of my Way: You gain access to the Shove Combat Maneuver


## Combat Maneuvers

During Combat, characters may use Combat Maneuvers through a combination of their weapons and skills. When delivering a Combat Maneuver, you replace the normal effect of your weapon with the effect of the Combat Maneuver. Call out the effect of the Maneuver as you strike your opponent. If your attack misses or is blocked, the Maneuver and its effect is expended. 

Combat includes combat maneuvers (things that combatants can do) and combat effects (the results of those actions). Combat maneuvers deliver damage and effects.
Combat Maneuvers require the expenditure of Grit to activate or fulfilling the requirements of a Combat Form.


## Combat Maneuvers

**Power/oomph/overcharge**
[all] Spend one grit to increase the power of the attack by one.

**Shove/Out of my way**
[all] Spend one grit to move into the space previously occupied by the opponent. Forces the opponent to move out of the space. 

## Basic Combat Effects

NOTE:: All of the effects below assume that the participants are acting in good faith. A player or NPC who is actively engaged in adjudicating a combat effect cannot be affected by another affect until the first call is completed.   
Safety trumps all effects; if rigorous adherence to the rules given for any effect is reasonably likely to cause harm, players are expected to adjust for safety.  If necessary call Hold and reset.

**Auto-Hit**
Several skills in the game allow the target to be struck automatically just via voice-call. When doing so, 
Call “Auto-Hit, Cunin, 1” or “Auto-hit, Tall Mamac, 1” (the effect, the target and the damage) This is so the target is aware there is a skill being used on them. Then you follow this with the effect being delivered. This is a larp; there are many players calling effects at times and sometimes the target is distracted. Choose targets carefully and understand that accidents can happen.

**Area Effects**
A wave or explosion that hits anything and everything in the area. 
The Area Effect modifier automatically hit the body of all targets within hearing. 
The length of this modifier is intentional to allows players and other staff alike to recognize it and ready themselves to react to the effect. 
Call, “All within the sound of my voice,” followed by the effect and any other modifier added.

**Disarm {X}** **—** You must drop the item held by the limb struck or the limb nearest to the point you were struck immediately and safely. If the attacker specifies an item, that item must instead be dropped.

**Fear** When you are targeted by a Fear effect you gain the condition Intimidated. If you have been under the effects of Intimidated for at least 15 seconds, a second Fear effect will cause you to become Panicked. 

**Parry** 
A physical save that may only be used against **melee** attacks if and if you (a) have a melee weapon in hand and (b) are aware of the attack

**Repel**
Attack with such force that the victim is forced to retreat; the attacker does not move.
Call “Repel 1”; the recipient of this attack must take seven  steps back away from combat (the recipient of the attack should wind up out of weapon range)

**Root**
Root binds a character to a location and prevents movement
Rooted players should pick one foot as the anchor point; that foot should not move for the duration of the root.
Call “Root 1”

**Shove**
You must move back two steps back or outside the attacker’s weapon range, whichever is farther.

**Sicken**
You may not be affected by Heal calls. This effect lasts until removed, when you perform a Rest, or is removed by spending a Grit.

**Slow**
The recipient of the Slow effect moves at a 1 second count. This means you take at least one second between steps. This lasts until healed or until you spend 15 seconds recovering from the effect.”

**Smash**
One handheld item you are using gains the broken condition. The holder of the object may not save against this effect except by saves granted specifically to protect objects. If you do not have a handheld item that is not already broken then instead a limb of your choice gains the smashed limb condition. If all of your limbs are already smashed then you are dropped to zero hit points and are incapacitated.

**Stun** 
You are unable to move or speak for 15 seconds. You must RP as though you are dazed. If anyone strikes or touches you while you are Stunned the effect immediately ends.

**Sunder**
*This effect* *has been merged into Smash.*

**must target a weapon or handheld item and is delivered by striking the item, not the person, and calling “Sunder”. The holder of the object may not save against this effect except by saves granted specifically to protect objects. If a Sunder hits a hand or claw boffer, the effect is treated as a Smash on the targeted limb. 

**Trip**
You must immediately make contact with the ground with three limbs, ie two arms and one leg, two legs and one arm, etc. Do so in a safe manner. If you are unable to do this, simply take a knee to meet the requirements.

**Unstoppable Effect**
The unstoppable modifier represents attacks against which there is no defense. 
Call “Unstoppable” and an effect, for example, "Unstoppable Smash,"; if the attack hits there is no defense and the effect goes through.

# More Rules
# Wounds

The world is full of dangers, and even the heartiest person can only endure so much. Every character has a certain number of Hit Points. When a character is reduced to 0 Hit Points they sustain an Injury, and become Incapacitated. At this point, the character is injured and the player must lie upon the ground until the Incapacitated condition is removed by the restoration of Hit Points through healing skills or items.

If you are Incapacitated and you have sustained 3 or more Injuries since your last Rest, you become Exhausted as you are overwhelmed by the volume of your wounds and injuries. An Exhausted character may not receive any beneficial effects except for those that remove the 

Exhausted Condition. An Exhausted character may not gain any more injuries or take any other actions.

Once the scene has ended an Exhausted character may get up and move at a slow pace toward the Triage. A character who is Incapacitated, but has not yet reached Exhausted may voluntarily gain the Exhausted condition as soon as it is clear to them that no healing assistance is coming. The goal of this is to not have players laying around waiting for healing to come, rather to get the player to the area where they can start to roleplay their recovery. If it looks like healing might be coming soon, stick around and allow the healers to have their roleplay.

**Things to Remember**


1. If it is unsafe to lay down to represent being Incapacitated then either take a knee until it is safe or stagger away to a safe spot and then lie down. If it ever becomes unsafe, feel free to move to ensure your safety.


2. Another character may help an Incapacitated character move at a walking pace.


3. If you are Incapacitated and another character tries to heal you, you are allowed to refuse the heal. You may choose to exercise this option if you fear you will simply sustain further Injuries if brought out of being Incapacitated. If you refuse an effect, any items or abilities that were used on you are considered unexpended.

**Triage and Injuries**
Injuries represent lasting wounds that must be properly examined and treated before they can be healed. In Lost Colonies this is represented by going to the Triage are of the event site. Once you arrive at the Triage, your Injuries will be diagnosed, and you will receive makeup, costuming, or both, to depict your wounds. You will also be informed of any mechanical consequences that afflict you during your recovery time. After one hour, you may recover from one Injury, or, if you have multiple, you may recover from all Injuries in two hours. When you recover from an injury, it is removed from your character, along with the penalties (We ask that you return the costuming to the Triage as soon as it is convenient!).

Aside from the specific penalties assigned for your injuries, nothing prevents you from continuing to act, explore, or take additional risks once your injuries are diagnosed. However, if you sustain any additional Injuries, it will reset the recovery time for ALL of them.
You may also choose to “Sleep off your wounds”, and leave play for a voluntary 2 Hour NPC shift. If you do so, you will recover from all injuries when you return. Similarly, your time spent on your scheduled NPC shift counts toward recovering from treated Injuries.
You may continue to act with untreated Injuries, but you may not Rest until your injuries are diagnosed at the Triage.


## Rest

When a character takes time away from heavy activities they are said to be resting. Rest normally requires 30 minutes, though abilities and skills may modify this. During a Rest, you should generally remain within the same location and may not use any skills or abilities except for completing standard Crafting Recipes, or skills that specifically can be used during a Rest.
Generally speaking a character is resting when they are not in combat and are not using any skills. Skills and Rituals require exertion and so Rituals, unlike crafting, do not count towards resting time.

The basic Rest time is 30 minutes, though abilities and skills may modify this. During a Rest, you should generally remain within the same location and may not use any skills or abilities except for completing standard Crafting Recipes, or skills that specifically can be used during a Rest. If your rest is interrupted, you must start over.

Once your Rest is complete, you can restore any missing Hit Points and regain any lost Saves, as well as use of any Skills that have a Once per Rest limitation on them.

## Grit

Grit is a special resource that every character possesses that represents an inner reserve of strength, resourcefulness and determination. Rests do not restore Grit, only effects that specifically restore Grit do. You may spend a point of Grit at any time to gain an additional use of any Skill you have with the Once Per Rest limit. You may decide which skill you are applying this to at the time you use the point. You may also gain additional uses for Grit through your other Skills, such as Combat Strikes or even Rituals.

## Scars

Throughout your time in Torakand, you will sustain injuries and, barring disaster, recover from them. However, circumstances and the story of your character may make you decide that a particular injury is too important to forget. In those moments you may instead choose to take the Injury as a permanent part of your character- a Scar.
Any Injury sustained by the character may be converted to a Scar, though no more than one per Event. The decision comes with significant benefits and significant consequences. Taking a scar is a permanent decision that counts as an unhealable Injury. In short, you come that much closer to risking death, as your capacity for raw punishment is permanently reduced. You gain two significant benefits. Firstly, you gain a permanent benefit to your character, symbolizing the lesson they have learned from this. As you sustain further Scars, your choices increase, but no selection can be chosen more than once (with one exception.) Secondly, any other remaining injuries fade after ten minutes- learning a permanent lesson makes the temporary pains easy to ignore.
NOTE: No character can have more than five Scars.
Scars must be costumed, and permanently incorporated into your character’s costuming and roleplay going forward, be it through makeup, clothing, armor, or all of the above.

**Scar Benefits**
You may choose one of the following. All effects are permanent.

- +2 Grit
- +1 Skill Slot
- Increase your HP cap by 5, to 20.
- Veteran’s Save - You gain one Save that can be used as either a Physical or a Mental Save, once per Rest. This Save cannot be modified or restored by any effect other than a Rest.
- +6 to your Build Cap

For your third and subsequent Scars, you may add the below choices to your list of options.

- A Unique Skill, the details of which are related to the injury you have taken, to be discussed with the Directors.
- A Second Chance - When you take this Scar, you identify the source of the failure that resulted in your current injury- be it a failed project, a particular adversary, or a specific creature. As a result of this Scar, Fate will conspire to give you a second chance toward settling the score, if not making things right. You may take this choice multiple times, but never twice over the same affair.

For your Fifth Scar, you may also add the below choices to your list of options.

- Create a Legacy - When you take this Scar, your actions echo long past your presence in Flint. You may design a unique, long-term or permanent effect for the entire colony, to be manifested upon your death. The details of this Scar must be discussed with Directors between events.
- Unbending Oath - When you take this Scar, you may declare a single, straightforward, achievable task, such as the defeat of a certain enemy or completion of a project. Until that task is completed, you cannot die: Taking your seventh Injury will result in you being unable to participate in the remainder of the event as that character, but you cannot die until that task is completed. The time limit on this effect is to be discussed with Directors but likely within the next game year, at which point the task must either be finished, or you retire your character as normal.
- Passing the Torch - When you take this scar, your character has become too important to Flint for them to be in further danger. You effectively retire your character from normal play, but can continue to make appearances to teach, dispense information, and participate in Role-Playing focused events such as the Governor’s Dinner.
## Death

A character who has seven total Injury points, including Scars, at any one time dies. The death happens at the end of the scene in which they received their seventh injury point.

Death is a permanent effect.

We at Lost Colonies want to reassure you that we are not trying to kill your characters. In fact we have designed the Injury, Scar, and Death systems in such a way as to give you, the player, agency over when and how your character meets their end. The Injury points are designed to allow your character time to reflect on how their choices led them to be so harmed. The Scar points allow your character to hold on to, and grow from, lessons learned through having faced challenges that have left them marked for life. And finally there are ways to gain Injury points that allow you to choose when your character's last breath will be. What hill will they die on? Who will be at their side? What will be the thing that was more important than themselves? We like to think that our Injury, Scar, and Death systems puts the power of those decisions in your hands.

**Certain Death Scenarios**
Now, imagine a scenario where your character would almost certainly die, but they are not near enough to seven injury points to mechanically die, what happens? You are allowed to work with the Storytellers to narrate how you narrowly escape the certain death situation. For example, if you are fighting a giant monster on the rim of an active volcano and are thrown off the edge, logically, you should be burnt to a crisp. If you are overrun by a herd of ravenous beasts, you should be their next meal. But, there is an aspect of cinematics at play symbolizing that you have some luck on your side, reflected in the gaining of Injury Points. So instead of being hurled fully into the volcano and dying, you are caught in a craggy outcropping, or an avalanche scares the herd away instead of you being eaten. You may always choose to follow a direct route and accept the circumstances as death, but remember that death is permanent.

## After Death

For a character to die, they must have a total of seven Injuries (including Scars) as we stated before. What happens next?

If your character dies we ask that someone is sent to get one of the Directors. We will help you through the next part of your character's journey. Once the Director is there they will have a quick conversation with you about the manner in which your character died and they will ask you to make a choice right then. Your options are to continue to play the spirit of your now dead character for a time, to switch to an NPC role for a time, or to head to logistics to make up a new character for the remainder of the event. If you do choose to play the spirit of your deceased character you will be asked to put on a blue headband to indicate that you cannot be interacted with in any fashion. You retain the memories of your character up to and including the moment of their death. You may speak with anyone and everyone can see you, but you may not invoke any effects aside from speech.

If you have been playing your spirit character there will come a time during that event when its spirit may no longer linger. This time may come at a moment of your choosing, or when the Directors tell you it is time. But it most certainly will come no later than the end of the event in which your Character dies. After the end of that event the spirit may only return when summoned by an active Character or when the Directors or Storyteller staff asks you to return as the spirit of the deceased.

## Sneaking Around

The Sneak skill is one way to gain the Hidden condition. There may be other ways. Regardless of the method used the following rules apply to the condition Hidden.

In order to communicate to everyone around you that you are hidden you must use one of these two methods.

- Option 1: Raise your arm up with a bent elbow so that your forearm crosses in front of your nose and is horizontal.
- Option 2: If you are going to remain hidden for a while you may also put on a Yellow Headband so that you can retain use of both arms (and not tire out the one arm).

While sneaking, you must move slower than a walking pace. A marshal may require you to slow down or lose your hidden condition. There will be only one warning. Marshals may declare that the use of Hidden abilities do not work on a per scene basis, at their discretion.

## Crafting

Any skill with the keyword "Crafting" is a crafting skill. Crafting skills all require that the characters have a recipe of some sort to follow. The recipe will indicate what Components are required, will say how much time the roleplay should take, will give a guideline for the roleplay to follow, and will tell you what to write on the resulting Item Card. Once you have completed the recipe you are to write up your own Item Card and you will initial it, date it, and include your Player number on the card. Any Component cards that are used up in the process should be placed into an Out-of-Game pocket or pouch so that they do not get confused with your remaining supplies. The next time you visit the Quartermaster you can turn in these used Components so that the game can return them to circulation again later.

Crafting skills do not require Marshals or Staff to complete. But if you need assistance as you get used to the skill or if you have a question about a recipe, please feel free to ask a Marshal for help.

**Experiments**
Whatever crafts your character may possess, they did not begin learning these difficult skills just to follow known recipes. Whether you wish to create an improved version of an existing recipe or design something new altogether, you can do this through the Experimentation process. Experimentation allows you to form a plan for your new design along with the materials, and consult a Marshal to prepare a Destiny Draw. Skills or Items with the tag “Experimentation” can improve the results of these Draws.

Experimentation can produce unexpected, dramatic, or even dangerous outcomes based on your materials, cleverness, and luck, good or ill. Because of the volatility of each experiment, it is difficult to reproduce the process exactly each time- so repeated attempts at the same product may not result in the same outcome. Turning one of your experimental results into a new recipe repeatable by anyone is a long term project requiring the highest levels of skill, typically through the ability Path to Discovery.

## Rituals

Any skill with the keyword "Ritual" is a ritual skill. Many ritual skills are like crafting skills in that they produce an Item Card. For these rituals you can simply follow the Crafting guidelines above to produce your own Item Cards. However, there are rituals that can only be done with the presence of a Marshal or Storyteller. If these rituals are conducted without a Marshal or Storyteller present they will simply fail.

## Props and Item Cards

Weapons and Armor must be represented by physical props. Not all weapons or armor will have item cards to go with them.

- A weapon without an item card is treated as a basic weapon of the type represented by the prop.
- Armor without an item card is treated as basic armor.
- Enchanted items require props and cards both. A magic wand without a card is just a fancy stick. An "Enchanted Item" card without a prop is not considered to be in game. The card does not need to be attached to the prop, but if there is a question of legitimacy, the card needs to be able to be produced in short order.
- All other Item cards do not require a prop. As a guideline, you should limit yourself to carrying about 10 "un-propped" Item cards per pouch or pocket. If you have a larger container, it is reasonable to carry more un-propped cards in it. While we recommend having as many things represented by props as possible we also recognize that that is not practical for all situations.
## Gathering

Expeditions to gather resources or other adventures into the wilderness will result in opportunities to gather Resources. Unless modified by the circumstances of the story as directed by a Marshal, Gathering works as follows:

At the end of the gathering scene, the Marshal will declare what resources are available in the scene. If your character possesses the necessary skill to harvest one of those resources, they may make a Destiny Draw. Higher results indicate the discovery of more or rarer resources. If you do not possess a relevant gathering skill, you may choose to either make a single card draw with your final possible result limited to +1 (A single common resource), or contribute to someone else’s efforts, adding a +1 to their final total. Up to two unskilled gatherers can assist one skilled one.
