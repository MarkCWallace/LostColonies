# Getting Started
All of the things you need to know before you start playing

## How to use this Document

This rulebook is intended to provide the essential information you will need to participate in a Lost Colonies event.  
Getting Started contains the Lost Colonies safety and community standards; this is all the information you need *before* you start play.  We expect that all players will have read this material, and every player should expect that every other participant (player, staff, etc.) will conduct their behavior according to these standards. 

- Safety and Community Standards: these explain the fundamentals of our gameplay philosophy and the culture that we aspire to achieve and maintain here at Lost Colonies.
- Character Creation: this is a step-by-step guide to creating your unique character. This section explains the mechanical and roleplay components that go into your character, starting with Region, Ancestry, Background, and Guild. You will also select your character’s starting Attributes. These traits help define your character and their role in the colony. Once you have created your character, you will be ready to explore sections that describe the elements of gameplay.

Rulebook contains the core rules. These are the rules you are most likely to consult during the game.  Players are expected to be familiar with the rules that are relevant to their character.

- Combat: this section includes information about Wounds, Injuries, Scars, and Death, and explains our unique way of handling the bad stuff that can happen to a character.

References contains

- Reference: this is where we list many of the details that flesh out the world of Lost Colonies. This includes sample recipes for crafting and rituals, how to make mundane and magical items or effects, and a list of effects and skills which define all the things that characters can do or the effects they may be subject to.
- Out of Game Errata: This section explains NPC shift, camp cleanup, service points, and other rules and expectations that come with being part of the Lost Colonies player community.

This rulebook does **not** include:

- A comprehensive guide to roleplay or character acting, and gives only a brief overview of larping as a hobby, if you are interested in further resources or tips, there are many excellent resources available online
- We do not attempt to address all possible rules conflicts. While we have tried to create a simple, cooperative system, we cannot foresee all eventualities. If conflicts or confusion should arise, Marshals will determine an appropriate course of action, and will have final say in all decision-making.

These rules will continue to evolve; our rules system is designed to give players the freedom to invent new recipes, use skills in innovative ways, and even develop new skills through roleplay and storytelling. As such, players should expect that the list of available skills and their limitations will grow over time.  We will publish updates to the rules as needed.

# Introduction

You are a colonist and an explorer in a strange new land. You were selected from among many applicants for a challenging and specialized role in a place far from your home. By the light of day, you are working a trade, gathering supplies, or guarding the colony, and by candle light at night you puzzle over relics found in this new world, craft poultices, conduct rituals, or defend your fellow colonists from strange new things that lurk in the darkness. You were selected in part because your talents are various, spanning beyond your primary trade or craft. Welcome to Torakand, where you will need to do whatever you can to ensure the survival of the colony.

## What is Live Action Role Playing?

Like most role playing games, Live Action Role Playing (LARP, Larp, or larp) puts you in the role of a Character, but instead of sitting around a table and describing your actions or controlling them on a computer screen, you get to act them out and actively participate in the world. Where you stand, what you say, the actions you take all represent your character’s personality, opinions, and choices. Think of it as a form of improvisational theater.

## Cultures and Costuming

The world we present is a fictional one, designed from the ground up to be accessible to a wide variety of participants. The characters in this world come from a variety of diverse fictional countries and cultures inspired by both history and high fantasy. The clothing for each region is based mostly on its climate, resources, history, and technology. In building our world, we deliberately chose to incorporate some familiar aesthetic elements from real-world cultures as a practical way to make it easier for players to find costumes. We specifically advise, however, that when creating their costumes, players avoid cliches or harmful stereotypes associated with the costuming they have chosen, and present themselves in a respectful and culturally sensitive way.

## General Costuming Guidelines

Lost Colonies is a colonial fantasy setting. To encourage immersion in this setting, it is expected that participants make a good attempt at wearing costuming suitable for the setting. Each region (see Chapter 3) has detailed guidelines for on costuming for that region, but here are some general guidelines:

- In general, costumes inspired by pre-1800s clothing from anywhere in the world is acceptable.
- Steampunk is a great aesthetic, this is not a steampunk larp, and steampunk-inspired costuming is not appropriate for Lost Colonies.
- Clothing that appears distinctly modern or that goes into the realm of fetish gear is also unacceptable.

## Statement on Colonialism

Lost Colonies is NOT an alternate history larp. We do not in any way condone or glorify the acts of genocide and slavery that have accompanied historical colonization of various places on Earth. The story we intend to tell celebrates the spirit of adventure, exploration, and discovery, and takes place in a strictly fictional setting. *Stories of genocide or maltreatment of native populations will never be presented as part of the story and they are expressly prohibited as choices available to the players to make.*

To be very clear, *there are no natives to the lands that the player characters inhabit.*

The lands surrounding the colony are dangerous and full of wildlife and other hazards. The Colony of Flint, and its homesteads, are not alone however. There are other pockets of civilization on Torakand and we will refer to these other pockets of civilization as neighbors. Exactly who these neighbors are is a subject for plot to explore but one thing is very important to state up front, they are NOT an analog for "people to be subjugated, conquered, exploited or killed".

Eventually players will be able to make characters that come from these neighboring regions.

# Safety and Community Standards


Here at Lost Colonies, we place the safety of our players and staff above all other considerations. We have established these safety and community standards to ensure that players have a safe, supportive, and comfortable experience. Both players and staff are expected to abide by these rules at all times, and anyone who fails to do so may face penalties, be dismissed from the game without a refund, or even - in particularly serious circumstances - be banned from Lost Colonies events indefinitely.

## Consent

At any time, players are free to opt out of a scene if they are uncomfortable, without IG or OOG repercussions. There are two tools a Player may use to indicate this: the Hold and the Lookdown. See Hold and Lookdown elsewhere in this document

## PG-13 Rating

The target content rating for our events is “PG-13.” We are not looking to police language or conversation topics (with the exception of the Off-Limits Topics below), but we strive for an environment that is not hostile, needlessly violent, or otherwise unpleasant, and we expect players to respect this.

## Off-Limits Topics

There are certain topics that are completely off limits. It does not matter who is involved in the scene or how the individuals present personally feel about these topics, Off-Limits Topics will never be present in this game for any reason.

- *No scenes will involve rape or sexual assault*
- *No scenes will involve slavery*
- *No scenes will include genocide*

## Makeup and Skin Coloration

*No costume will include full face or body makeup that mimics a natural human skin tone.* All Ancestries or monsters that require face or body paint specify a color that is clearly not a real-world skin tone, such as purple, blue, or green. We recommend that any prosthetics applied as part of a costume or makeup be made to match your natural skin tone, or to match the non-natural skin paint specified for best effect.

## Accommodating Player Belief Systems

Just because we are all taking on the persona of imaginary people does not mean that our real world belief systems stop applying. Staff will always do their best to accommodate any religious necessities, and other players are expected to always be respectful of others’ sincerely held beliefs. That said, staff cannot anticipate all necessities, so if you need any form of special support, please let staff know how we can help and we will do everything we can to accommodate you. 
Furthermore, you may always incorporate any special garments or wearables associated with your religious beliefs into your costume, regardless of your character’s background, staff will never ask you to remove these items. If you need to take yourself OOG for prayer or other observances, you are welcome to do so without obstruction or penalty.

> Example: Cultural or religious head coverings may be worn IG and you never need to remove them. These kinds of head coverings are supported by the costuming standards and the lore and you are not limited to one particular Region of the world, either.
> Example: If you participate in daily observances of prayer at certain times, you are more than welcome to take yourself out of game and head to the Quiet Room or another safe location for the time you need.


## Zero Tolerance Policy for Discrimination

Lost Colonies strives to be a safe, supportive, and fully inclusive space for people of all genders, sexualities, ethnicities, religions, backgrounds, cultures, classes, abilities, and all other features that make us humans unique. There will be absolutely no tolerance for hate speech, discriminatory behavior, harmful caricature, mockery, or any other behaviors that victimize, harm or exclude anyone for any reason. Violation of this policy will be addressed by the directors and penalized with the appropriate severity. If you feel you have been the victim of discriminatory behavior from players or staff, please bring this to the attention of the directors immediately.

## Accommodating Dietary Restrictions

If you have certain food restrictions, regardless of reason, please let us know at least one week in advance of the event. We will do our best to ensure that any food provided by the Lost Colonies Larp is appropriately labeled to alert of possible allergy concerns as well as vegetarian versus non-vegetarian choices. Advanced notice will make this easier on the staff.

## Accessibility and Medical Needs

Lost Colonies will make every effort possibly, within the confines of the facilities we use, to make our events accessible and to help with special medical needs. While our events take place largely outdoors and involve certain aspects of physicality, we are happy to provide whatever support we can to make Lost Colonies welcoming for those with differing needs and abilities. If you need access to electricity, or other support, please let staff know ahead of time and we will work with you. *No special permission is required to sleep Out-of-Game.*

## Respecting Names and Genders

Players are expected to use and respect the names, nicknames, and pronouns of their fellow players. If you mistakenly use the wrong name or pronoun, quickly and unobtrusively correct yourself or politely accept correction from others, and then make a sincere effort to remember in the future. It is expected that simple mistakes may happen, but deliberate misgendering or ongoing failure to respect other players will be considered malicious, and will result in penalties including eventual removal from our events.

Remember that players may also be playing a character of a different gender than themselves, so if you are unsure, find an opportunity to politely ask them, preferably in private.  

## Safety Check Hand Signals

If at any point you are concerned about another player, you can check their well being without breaking immersion using the “safety check” signal. To initiate a “safety check,” make eye contact with another player and make a thumbs up hand signal in front of your chest. Once the other player has recognized the hand signal, they may respond in one of three ways:

- A thumbs-up sign indicates that everything is going fine, and play can proceed.
- A level-hand or “wishy washy” hand motion means that the player is uncertain. In this case, either excuse yourself and the other player from the scene or break the scene and ensure the other player is able to continue. Treat this as a thumbs-down until the player establishes that they are able to continue.
- A thumbs-down sign indicates that things are not OK. The checker should escort the other player away, give them the opportunity to excuse them-self, or stop the scene entirely. Players exiting a scene should place a fist on their head or put on white headbands to indicate that they are going out of game. The player who has indicated that they are “not OK” should be given the opportunity to indicate what help they need. When in doubt, escort them to the Quiet Room or find a member of our medical staff. If you feel comfortable doing so, please report any serious issues to one or more of the marshals or the directors so we can help out as needed.

## Self Check

We believe that a good larp community checks in on each other to ensure we are all happy and safe, but it is also useful to practice a “self-check” regularly. Throughout the event, pause to assess your own well-being to make sure you continue to enjoy your experience and care for your own emotional and physical needs. If you find yourself stressed or struggling to continue, ask yourself these questions:

- Have I had any water recently?
- Have I had enough to eat?
- Am I warm enough / cool enough?
- Are my socks dry?
- Have I injured anything?
- Have I had enough sleep?
- Have I been on my feet too long?
- Do I need to sit down and rest?
- Do I need some quiet?
- Am I emotionally well?

## Following the Rules

***Marshals and Staff Have Final Say***
It is impossible to anticipate every situation, and this rulebook cannot possibly cover every scenario that may arise. In any situation where the rules are in question, marshals and
staff are empowered to make judgment calls or adjudicate rules conflicts. A marshal’s decision always supersedes the written word of the rulebook, but never permanently sets a precedent. Marshals are empowered to “undo” player actions and reset part of a scene if they judge that a player has acted in a way inconsistent with the rules or their character’s abilities.
If a specific rule is found to be a source of problems or confusion, it should be brought to the staff’s attention, and may be adjusted for future events. A storyteller is also empowered to make rulings that affect a whole scene, as long as those rulings do not contradict the Safety and Community standards. To avoid long holdups in the game, please do not argue with marshals or storytellers when they make a ruling. After the scene is done, if you feel that the call was in error, please bring the concern to the directors along with the name of the staff involved in the call. The directors will review, make a final ruling, and may adjust the outcome or future outcomes as necessary.
The directors will always do their best to resolve conflicts to the satisfaction of all parties involved, but will keep fairness and the cooperative intent of the rules as their primary consideration. The ability to appeal to the directors should not be abused, and this option is not meant for players to simply “go over the head” of a marshal because a decision did not benefit them personally. Directors will never alter a marshal’s decision solely because a player complains.
In most cases, rule-breaking is a genuine mistake or the result of simple misunderstanding, so trying to clear up this misunderstanding patiently is the best course of action. If a player is deliberately cheating or gaming the rules, however, they may detract from other players’ experiences and harm the cooperative aspects of the game. If you believe a player is breaking the rules, or if there is a disagreement about rules interpretation, promptly bring this to the attention of a marshal or other staff.

## Interpreting the Rules

Lost Colonies supports and rewards creative thinking and clever use of game mechanics, however players should never take advantage of this to cheat or look for loopholes. If you are unsure of how something is supposed to work, ask a staff member first. Do not “read between the lines,” make assumptions, or exploit vagueness or human error to gain an advantage or detract from other players’ experiences.

**IG vs. OOG Knowledge**
Even for experienced players, it is never possible to fully separate what the player knows from what their character knows, but players must strive to avoid using out of game (OOG) knowledge that their character does not possess during gameplay. The intentional use of OOG knowledge to benefit a character is called metagaming.
The exception to this rule is character secrets. If you wish specifically to keep something a secret in-game, you are expected keep it a secret out of game as well. If a player knowingly shares a specific character secret with other players, even when shared away from the game space, then any player that hears that secret may consider it in-game (IG) knowledge at their discretion.
This exception may seem contradictory to the general rule on metagaming, but it’s simply a matter of practicality. It is almost impossible to fairly adjudicate a situation where players have a major, important piece of information, but must indefinitely pretend that they don’t. These circumstances lead to unintentional metagaming and may cause frustration and resentment. As such, if a player shares a character secret with other players, it will be presumed that this knowledge was overheard or let slip within the setting of the game as well, and players will not be penalized for acting on that knowledge.

> Example of a Secret: Player A brags about killing a beloved NPC at a restaurant after the event when many other players are within earshot. This knowledge is important to the game, and players emotionally invested in this NPC continue to discuss this knowledge out of game, making it effectively common knowledge within the player base. If other players call for Player A’s arrest at the next game and claim that they heard a rumor of Player A’s guilt, this would not be considered a violation of the rules.

> Example of Meta-Gaming: Player Q overhead the storytellers talking and learned that NPC Bob is secretly a traitor. NPC Bob later approaches Player Q’s character and asks for help identifying a gemstone in a cave. With no apparent motive, Player Q asks for directions to the cave, then attacks and kills the NPC and goes to steal the gemstone. Since NPC Bob never gave any indication of being a traitor, Player Q’s character had no rational reason to murder them. This type of metagaming only diminishes the experience and may interfere with other peoples’ gameplay or with the story. As in all scenarios, Player Q has the option to simply refuse to help NPC Bob if they so choose, but in this case they abused their metagame knowledge.

Please note, however, that it is always ok to share character secrets with the directors and storytellers, as they do not play PCs and will keep your secrets in confidence.

If you find yourself in a situation where a small piece of OOG knowledge may help the scene move forward or enhance other players’ experience, use of that knowledge will not be penalized. For example, if players are lost on a quest and becoming frustrated, suggesting “maybe we should check in that field” because you happen to know the storytellers were there earlier is not an abuse of OOG information.

**Playing Npcs with Out-of-Game Knowledge**
When you play as an NPC as part of your NPC shift you will necessarily be exposed to some behind-the-scenes knowledge. Players are expected to do their very best to always maintain story integrity by not letting knowledge gained on their NPC shift affect their character’s choices.
Whenever you play an NPC, your PC is to have no direct actionable knowledge of that NPC whatsoever. If other players discuss an NPC you have played, either as a full-time NPC or on your 4-hour shift, you should behave as though you are fairly disinterested in whatever they have to say about that NPC, and avoid engaging in discussion about them as much as possible. This is to prevent NPC knowledge becoming entangled with your PC’s knowledge.

**Rules Violations**
Rules Violations are a mechanism to document player misconduct. Rules Violations are given to the player, not the character. If a marshal issues a Rules Violation, then it will be added to all Character Cards of the Player. Each Rules Violation will remain on the Character Cards for six events and are afterwards removed from the cards. If a player accumulates four Rules Violations, then they will be permanently banned from the game.
A marshal may only give a player one Rules Violation per incident, but a director may give a player multiple Rules Violations for one incident if they rule that a violation is especially severe. An incident is usually a single violation of the rules, but it may be a series of related violations - such as several dangerous actions during combat scene - that the marshal is resolving as part of one incident. A marshal may escalate an incident to a director if they feel that it needs to be addressed further, or if they feel it is severe enough to warrant more than one Rules Violation.

**Obeying the Law**
Reality is not suspended at Larp. Anything that is illegal in reality is illegal during game. This includes but is not limited to harassment, use of illegal substances, trespassing, property damage, and assault. Furthermore, consumption of alcohol at ordinary game events is strictly prohibited, regardless of player’s age. Players found to be violating any law will be escorted off the premises immediately, banned from game indefinitely, and law enforcement may be called at the directors’ discretion.

# Character Creation

## Choose your Ancestry, Region, Background, and Starting Guild

Your character is a multifaceted person, who is bringing valuable knowledge and skills from their homeland to this new colony. Mechanically, your character’s Region, Ancestry, Background, and Starting Guild determine where they come from, what they look like, what their role was back home, and what they are here to contribute to the colony. These choices are perhaps the most important decisions you will make during character creation.


- **Ancestry** indicates the family heritage of your character and what, if any, makeup requirements come with that Ancestry. There is no advantage, disadvantage, or skill that is determined by your Ancestry, it simply determines your character’s appearance and some aspects of your roleplay. 

- **Region** determines where your character hails from and what kind of clothing your character prefers as a result. You will also be able to choose one skill from a list of skills specific to your Region to reflect the impact growing up in that Region had on your character.

- **Background** reflects how your character lived before joining the colony. This will largely be informed by their previous profession, as well as their level and type of education. You will also be able to choose one skill from a list of skills associated with your profession, to reflect aspects of your training and expertise.

- **Guild:** The Colony of Flint operates under a guild structure, and every colonist is grouped into a guild based on their skills and interests. Every colonist must be sponsored by a guild to travel to Flint, and as such, you will need to choose a guild to join based on what role you wish to play in the colony. You will also be able to choose one of the many skills associated with your chosen guild at the time of character creation.

## Choose Your Starting Skills

Based on your Region, Background, and starting Guild, you will begin with 3 skills. As your Character advances they will be able to gain new skills from their Region, Background, and Guild assuming they meet the prerequisites. You should pick your starting skills before you pick your starting attribute values so that you can be sure that you meet all prerequisites for your chosen starting skills. If a skill lists another skill as a prerequisite you may ignore that requirement *during character creation* only.

## Primary Attributes

Your character has 7 primary attributes, which indicate in a general sense their strengths and weaknesses. The 7 primary attributes are:

- ***Wits*** represent your Character’s intuition, intellect, and problem solving ability. Wits factors into your Character’s Mentals Saves and is a prerequisite for skills that require thinking.
- ***Strength*** represents your Character’s brawn and ability to do physical activity. Strength factors into Hit Points and is a prerequisite for skills that require physical might.
- ***Essence*** represents your Character’s inner self, or “internal spark.” Essence factors into Hit Points and is a prerequisite for skills that interact with the spiritual world.
- ***Agility*** represents your Character’s deftness, grace, and ability to manipulate delicate components. Agility factors into your Character’s Physical Saves and is a prerequisite for skills that require physical dexterity.
- ***Resolve*** represents your Character’s physical toughness and stamina. Resolve factors into your Character’s Physical Saves and is a prerequisite for skills that require steadfastness of body.
- ***Focus*** represents your Character’s mental toughness and ability to concentrate. Focus factors into your Character’s Mental Saves and is a prerequisite for skills that require mental dedication.
- ***Harmony*** represents your Character’s ability to balance Mind, Body, and Soul. It factors into the Secondary Attribute of Grit.

Each attribute has an automatic baseline of 1 point and you have 20 additional points to distribute among these attributes as you see fit for a total of 27. At the time of character creation you may have no more than 7 points total in any one attribute. Keep in mind the kind of person your character is, and what personality traits they have cultivated. You should also reference the list of skills associated with your starting guild, as some have prerequisites that you may want to ensure you can easily meet in the future.

## Secondary Attributes

Secondary attributes are mechanical elements of your character that are calculated based on your chosen primary attributes. After finalizing your Primary Attributes, calculate your Secondary Attributes using the following formulas.

***Hit Points*** (Strength + Essence) / divided by 2, rounded down 

This is the amount of damage your Character can take before they are incapacitated.

***Hit Point Cap*** (15) 

Your Character’s permanent Hit Points can never exceed this Hit Point Cap. All Characters have a starting Hit Point Cap of 15. Scars may increase this cap but never above 20.

***Physical Saves*** (Agility + Resolve) / divided by 10, rounded down + 1

These saves counter Hit Point damage and Physical Effects that have successfully targeted you. This includes melee weapon strikes, ranged weapon darts, and spell packets causing physical damage or physical effects.

***Mental Saves*** (Wits + Focus) / divided by 10, rounded down + 1

These saves counter Mental Attacks and Mental Effects delivered within line of sight.

***Grit*** (Harmony) / divided by 5, rounded down + 1 

Spend a Grit point to immediately refresh one skill as though you had rested. Grit points do not refresh because of a Rest, but there are ways to gain Grit Points back. You may not gain Grit Points above your Grit number.

***Skills*** Primary Attribute Points) / divided by 10, rounded down + 1

This is the number of skills that your Character can know. Scars may increase this number.

IMPORTANT: Your starting character should have twenty seven (27) total Primary Attribute points. No single Primary Attribute may be greater than 7 or less than 1.

## Ancestries

Ancestry determines only the makeup requirements and may also influence character personality, but the final decisions are up to you. In addition to those listed here we do allow for ancestries to blend together. So if you have an idea for a character that is a combination of multiple ancestries, run it by the Directors for approval.

### Aeldin

Makeup Requirements: Must use pointed ears matching your natural skin color. 

### Alloyim

Makeup Requirements: May not add any prosthetics or makeup aside from makeup needed for scars or that looks like makeup the Character applied to themselves.

### Bisad

Makeup Requirements: At least two of the following: fur, whiskers, ears, eyes, tail, or paws much like great cats or domestic ones.  Bisad do not have fur on their faces. 

### Erdenkind

Makeup Requirements: Must have some area of metallic or mineral colored paint on their face or hands.  This may be in a pattern.

### Faedin

### Mamac

Makeup Requirements: At least two of the following: tusks, horns, forehead bone ridge, skins of hues green. (Note, Players who choose not to use green skin should retain their natural skin tone.)

### Zahnir

Makeup Requirements: At least two of the following: canine nose, ears, tail, fur, or paws. Zahnir do not have fur on their faces.

## Regions

Every PC started their life living on the continent of Sobukand. Sobukand is currently run as a single empire lead by two empresses. Before the empire was founded however the land was divided into various kingdoms and the borders of these kingdoms at the formation of the empire were essentially preserved. These former kingdoms are now called provinces in the official documentation of the empire, but for the purpose of Character creation we call them Regions. Below you will find the relevant information needed for Character creation. For more detailed information on an individual Region, please see the supplemental Region Guides available on the Lore section of our website. https://lostcolonieslarp.com/

IMPORTANT: The Continent of Sobukand is in the Southern Hemisphere, so as you go farther south, the climate gets generally colder.

The Regions in our world are similar geographically or climate wise to locations in the real world. We used those features when designing the Regions to allow us to offer as much variety in clothing options as possible. This also means that we do not need to reinvent the wheel for all costume designs which should lower the barrier to entry for costuming this larp. The goal is to be inclusive rather than exclusionary.

However, we must take great care to treat the real world cultures that inspire our Regions with respect. *We reserve the right to ask you to modify your costuming if there is a perception of disrespect to a real world culture.* A little bit of research can go a long way to avoiding problems of this nature.

Not sure if your costume might be cultural appropriation? Ask us! We are happy to review pictures of your costume or its components for you and if we aren't sure we can also ask others in the community to get a consensus. We may also have ideas of how to adjust existing pieces to be more appropriate.

## Northern Regions

The Northern Regions of Sobukand are generally warm and full of a wide variety of plant and animal life. The imperial capital city of Casere was located on a spot of land that most would have considered part of Feldland. This location, while technically in the north, was chosen for its proximity to trade routes between north and south and river access on the Micelburn.

### Holthar

Clothing: Styles inspired by European cultures from the medieval era through the 18th century. Holthar tends to have styles that are later in this time period. Additionally, styles inspired by pre-Revolutionary War America are common. Fabrics like cotton, wool, and silk are all readily available through trade.
Geography: Warm and heavily forested
Skills: *Appraise, Trapping and Foraging, First Aid, Apprentice Herbalism I*

### Teyen

Clothing: Styles inspired by Asian cultures from the 6th century to the 18th century. Silk is locally produced and readily available. Trade also makes cotton and wool easy to obtain.
Geography: Rainforest
Skills: *Apprentice Herbalism I, Fiber Arts, Remove Poison*

### Feldland

Clothing: Lightweight clothing inspired by the Native American tribes from the American Great Plains, the cultures of the Nile river valley of Ancient Egypt, African nomadic tribes, or similar nomadic or river basin cultures. Cotton and linen are the most commonly available fabrics but silk is also available.
Geography: Great plains. Major river floods annually. Large roaming herds of sheep and bison.
Skills: *Trapping and Foraging, Initiate Spirit Rituals, Creature Handling, Orienteering*

## Southern Regions

The Southern Regions of Sobukand are generally cold and the people who live there are used to a more difficult life. This leads to a practical problem-solving process.

### Sorjund

Clothing: Styles inspired by European cultures from the medieval era through the 18th century. Sorjund tends to have styles that are earlier in this time period. Additionally, Mongolian, Scottish, Celtic, and Irish inspired clothing is common. Wool is commonly available with cotton becoming more prevalent in recent decades.
Geography: Cold, tundra, wasteland, swamps, bogs
Skills: *Apprentice Alchemist I, Blacksmith, Trapping and Foraging, Mining*

### Terradinum

Clothing: Styles range a bit but the clothing is generally in earth tones and is practical for work or for use in subterranean settings. A wool like fabric is locally available but fabrics from all over are regularly imported.
Geography: Subterranean
Skills: *Appraise, Mining, Gunsmith*

### Kairn Handia

Clothing: Styles are generally made of simple, modest clothing, often with wide belts and sashes. Wool is the primary fabric with cotton and linen also available.
Geography: Mountaintop
Skills: *Basic Logistics, Initiate Binding Rituals, Wilderness Survival*

## Coastal Regions

These regions are only accessible by ship, and as such, they tend to be the most independent from the empire on a day-to-day basis. While officially part of the empire (at least according to the empire) the residents of these regions are least impacted in their daily lives by imperial rule.

### Ziel

Clothing: Styles inspired by sailing cultures from the medieval era through the 18th century. Cotton and silk fabrics are both readily available.
Geography: Rocky coastal port towns
Skills: *Import Export, Inspire Courage, Smuggle*

### Bidawa Hadir

Clothing: Styles include clothing suitable for living and travelling in a desert. This can mean light clothing for the daytime and layers of clothing for night time when it can get very cold in the desert. Head wraps that can cover the face to defend against sandstorms are also common, but they are not worn unless they are needed. Linen and cotton fabrics readily available
Geography: Desert
Skills: *Orienteering, Basic Production, Dowsing*

### Liber

Clothing: Styles include clothing inspired by traditional Caribbean or Pacific islander styles. Additionally, clothing styles are also imported from Ziel and Teyen because of the frequency of trade that occurs between them.
Geography: Island
Skills: *Cooking, Import Export, Dissect*

## Other Regions

^1^ [small]#Exiled is a background with special meaning. In the early events of Lost Colonies a group of people were exiled from Flint for their crimes. One of the exiles, Dandy Jack, was able to negotiate for the exiles to be re-integrated into polite society. Taking the Exiled background means that you arrived in Flint some time ago (less than 10 years though), committed a crime worthy of exile, and have recently been allowed back.#

NOTE: If you do not see a background that makes sense for your character there are still options. Option 1 is to pick a Skill from the above list that you do like and simply share with us how your character learned that skill from their background.  Maybe instead of a carpenter they were a barrel maker or something like that. The important thing is that the background adds to your character's depth and gives you one skill from the above list. Option 2 is to propose a new background and skill pairing to the Directors and see if you get approval.

### Character Advancement

Characters who participate in Events and accomplish Quests will grow in power. Lost Colonies measure character growth through Build or Build points. The sections below explain how to earn build and how to spend build to improve a character.

**How to Earn Build**

Characters earn build for participating in Lost Colonies:

- Characters earn one Build point for attending an Event.
- Characters earn Build points for completing Quests. Some Quests may take multiple Events to complete.

Special cases to earn build

- An Admission ticket to a Lost Colonies Event entitles the Player to play one Character. A Player who has more than one Player Character (commonly called “Alts”) must pay an extra fee per additional Character. Each additional Character thus paid for also earns the Attendance count and the one Build for attending.
- Players who miss an event (even events that occurred before they joined the larp) may pay for Events they missed, and earn the build they would have earned through attendance. This gives new players a way to "catch up" with existing players. Players who pre-pay for future Events will earn the attendance credit for those Events once the Event has occurred.

**How to Spend Build**

Characters can spend Build to improve their character.

- Each Build point increases a Primary Attribute by one. Simply write the change onto your character sheet before placing it back in your envelope at the end of the event.
- Between events the team will update your character sheet in our database and print you a new one. This will automatically calculate the changes in your character's Secondary Attributes. An increase in Primary Attributes may result in increased Hit Points, Saves, Grit, or an additional Skill Slot. (Remember that the number of skills is based on the sum of the Primary Attributes; every tenth Attribute point will grant an additional Skill Slot.)
- If a Character earns a Skill Slot, the Player should choose a Skill from the list of skills appropriate for that character.
- Characters should choose new skills from the skill lists for their Region, Background, and Guild(s). Assuming the Character meets all of the prerequisites for the chosen Skill, the Character learns the Skill and it will be on their character sheet at the start of the next Event. Skills chosen during an Event are not available until the next Event. This is to prevent people from basing Skill choices off of the theme for an Event and gaining an advantage as a result.

Limits on spending build

- Characters may earn build without limit, but Characters may not spend more Build than six times the number of Events that Character has attended.

## Character Skills

**What are Skills?**
Your character comes to Torakand possessing a number of skills, showing their expertise and talent, and can learn more as part of their adventures. You can make use of these skills in a number of ways. A skill will also list the prerequisites required to obtain that skill, as well as a description of the skill. A skill’s description will contain one or more tags, described below, which explain when, where, and how often a skill can be used. A full list of tags is available below.
Some skills have multiple named benefits contained within one skill, called talents. These individual talents will have its own set of tags about when and how they can be used as needed.
In order to use a skill or talent within a skill, you simply need to perform the roleplaying described in the skill. Some will require you to specifically call out the name of the skill or talent to produce their effect. This call will be detailed in the description. If a skill or talent grants you an additional Save against a specific effect, you do not need to call anything other than “Save.” You can safely assume to use the most limited applicable save benefit you have first, as long as you take care to not exceed the total number of Saves you have available.
If an injury or effect temporarily reduces your attributes below the requirements of the skill, you will not lose access to the skill.

## Teaching and Learning New Skills

For every ten points of build your character spends they gain a new Skill Slot. A character who has an available Skill Slot or is about to obtain one from the Build spent this event may learn a new Skill.

In order to learn a Skill, you must possess both the necessary attribute scores, as detailed on the Skill, as well as any prerequisite skills needed. In order to learn the skill, you must find someone to teach you, typically a Guild leader or a more seasoned character who possesses the Skill. A lesson should take at least fifteen minutes of roleplay, and may be broken up in a series of discussions over the weekend. Once the Lesson is complete write on your character sheet the new skill name below your other skills. The teacher may also have a quest to teach a skill, if so the player learning the skill can sign the quest card for the teacher. If the teacher of the skill was another player, they may also gain a one Build Quest for teaching. You may only gain one learning or teaching-related quest per event, regardless of how many skills you teach or lessons you take.

**Skills and Knowledge**
Your character possesses a number of skills that govern different disciplines, fields of study, and abilities. Regardless of the source of a skill, you may freely assume that you possess an intellectual or academic understanding of any skill you possess, in addition to any knowledge the skill explicitly grants. For example, the Banner Bearer skill would include some knowledge of military parade and procedure, or Gunsmithing with the basic understanding of how gunpowder weapons operate, or the history of guns. In short, you know intellectually what you know how to do, and can ask the Storytellers based on these skills for additional information based on the skills you possess. To use this, you should work into the roleplaying conversation a phrase that clearly indicates your knowledge. For example: “As a Brightsmith do I recall some information about this candelabra?” or “As an alchemist I once did an experiment with a variety of soapstones, do these look familiar to me?”

# Combat

We use foam weapons to simulate melee combat and we simulate range combat with foam dart guns and bean bags. We also allow for the use of shields. Staff will inspect your weapons at check-in, which takes place at the beginning of each event. Weapons safety checks are crucial to safe play and they are mandatory.
## Combat Authorization

Players who wish to participate in our combat system must qualify and adhere to all safety standards.

- Players must be at least 16 years of age to participate in combat
- Players must be medically healthy enough
    - If you have a medical reason which may make it unsafe for you to undertake intense physical activity, we highly recommend that you not partake in combat. We have dedicated non-combat areas and story at every event for this reason. We recognize that this may change from event to event, especially for people with certain conditions, and that no one knows your body as well as you. We trust our Players to make safe decisions about their own bodies and we expect the community to remain respectful and inclusive, which promotes safe play all around.
- Players must go through a short training class and be able to:
    - Demonstrate knowledge of the legal target areas
    - Demonstrate safe hits following the rules outlined below
    - Demonstrate safe dying pose and how to safely transition to the dying pose
    - Demonstrate safe reaction and quiet behavior during a HOLD
    - Demonstrate how to safely shoot a foam dart gun when their target is too close
- Authorizations must be renewed annually

When you first attend an event, if you are 16 years of age or older, we will instruct you on safe combat and test you on key safety procedures. When you pass this test, we grant you Combat Authorization, which is good for one year. During the course of an event, if marshals or staff witness you being unsafe during combat, they may remove your Combat Authorization. To regain your Combat Authorization, you will need to repeat the safety instruction and pass the test
again. Players who are younger than 16 who wish to participate in combat should come with their parent or guardian for their combat authorization and may be granted permission on a case by case basis.

## Hold and Clarify, or How to Pause the Game

*Hold*: Players and marshals may both use “Holds” to stop the game. Hold may be called for safety reasons, or so that a marshal or staff member may explain or narrate something. When calling a Hold, you must freeze in place and yell “Hold!” loud enough for everyone in the vicinity to hear you. If you hear someone else yell “Hold!,” you should also freeze and repeat it, to ensure everyone in the are can hear. Players in a Hold should also provide a visual indication of the Hold by either placing a closed fist on top of their head or holding a weapon on top of their head. Players should not approach a scene where a Hold has been called. Only staff or marshals may call a Hold to explain a scene, but any player can and should call a Hold if they believe there is a safety concern of any kind. If you have any suspicion that a player may be hurt or in danger, it is best to call a Hold, rather than risk harm to another person. Remember, safety is the most important aspect of larping!

*Clarify*: All players can call “Clarify” to ask another player or a staff member about a rule or effect. When calling Clarify, you should not shout it. Instead, say “Clarify” loudly enough for those within a ten-foot radius to hear. Players in the immediate area should pause to allow the uncertainty to be resolved without interruption. Additionally, the player who called Clarify should put a fist or weapon on their head to indicate that play is temporarily paused. If you use a skill and are asked to clarify, you should explain the skill you have used to the satisfaction of the other player.
*Lay On*: “Lay On” is called to indicate that the game may resume, usually preceded by a countdown to give warning (“3, 2, 1, Lay On”)
When you use a Hold or Clarify, all IG effects pause until Lay On is called. During a Hold or Clarify, you cannot be targeted by anything IG, and any IG actions taken are ignored as though they never happened. Players may not use a Hold or Clarify to gain any kind of advantage or take any kind of action, this includes players who are not directly involved in the Hold or Clarify. Players must also stay in place so that marshals and the person who called the Hold may quickly assess and address the situation.

## Physical representations & props

The following section outlines our rules for physical representations (physreps) of weapons and other items where the actual item is dangerous. 

Lost Colonies classifies weapons as follows:

- Fists: 12-18 inches, no crossguard and in a non-metallic color
- Small Melee: 12 to 24 inches
- Medium Melee: 18 to 42 inches
- Large Melee: 36 to 63 inches
- Side Arm: foam dart gun with a maximum length of 12 inches
- Long Gun: foam dart gun that is longer than 12 inches
- Shotgun: any foam dart gun that fires more than one dart per trigger pull is automatically considered a shotgun regardless of length
- Thrown Weapon: Must be entirely made of foam and contain no core or weights. May be latex or duct tape covered. Flexible tape may be used as a grip point.

**Shields**
A shield should be safe - for the person using it, their opponent, and any other items involved in the melee. Shields are defensive props used to block attacks, whether they are melee or projectiles. They cannot be used to attack or "bash" another player. A shield should be under the control of its bearer at all times and should not fly loose in combat.

Shields may be constructed from wood, plastic, foam or aluminum. They must have no sharp protrusions or edges. All edges must be padded with 3/8" pipe foam or thicker. Decoration of a shield is highly encouraged, for both RP and atmosphere purposes. Remember that this is not a high fantasy game, and that unenhanced shields will not protect you from bullets or magical attacks.

Shields should not cover the entirety of the strikeable areas on a player's body and the staff reserves the right to deny the use of a shield should it be deemed too large.

Maximum dimensions are as follows, and please note that these dimensions include the required padding around all edges:

- Bucklers can have a maximum diameter of 18", if circular, and if a polygonal shape then a maximum of 12" x 16". If polygonal then the maximum perimeter of the shield should be 56".
- Full size shields should have a maximum diameter of 36", if circular. If polygonal* then the maximum dimensions should be 24" x 36", with a maximum perimeter of 113".
- Shields may not be designed to catch weapons.

The staff reserves the right to approve or disallow all phys reps and props on a case-by-case basis, to which shields are no exception.

**Thrown Weapons**
All thrown physreps must be made entirely out of foam and not have any weights or cores in them. Thrown weapons may not be used in melee, even if they look like a javelin, spear, hatchet, or dagger. A weapon without a core has a much higher chance to whip or tear, making them unsafe for melee combat.

**Foam Dart Guns**
You may make reasonable external or internal modifications to your foam dart guns; however, any changes you make must be disclosed to us before they can be used and the physrep must be able to pass a safety inspection. We ask that you paint your physreps to cover any logos or branding, and if you choose to paint them in a realistic fashion, please leave the orange tip partially exposed for safety reasons. You may not use darts that have been modified in any way except with paint or writing to identify who they belong too.

If you have any questions on whether or not a particular foam dart gun and/or modification can be used at a Lost Colonies event, please reach out to the staff.  Please understand that for safety and design reasons, the staff has final say on whether or not a weapon is authorized for use.  

**Sidearms and Point Blank Shot**
Sidearms may not be loaded with more than 6 darts. Side Arms shall not be fired at targets who are closer than three feet from the end of your extended arm. Instead you may fire the dart at the ground and call "Point Blank Shot" to deliver an attack.

**Long Guns and Point Blank Shot**
Long guns may not be loaded with more than 6 darts. Long guns may not be used to deliver Point Blank Shots.

**Shotguns**
Shotguns apply damage and effects once per activation, NOT per dart. If a single activation from a shotgun manages to hit multiple targets then each target is affected by one activation. You may not load shotguns with more than 3 activations worth of darts. Shotguns can be used to deliver Point Blank Shots (see Sidearm section above). 

**Foam Dart Guns vs. Attacks**

- Gun physreps do not protect against anything.
- When you get into melee weapon range you must lower your gun to your side.
- Never make contact with your gun to a melee weapon or to another Player.

**Spells** 

(Spackets) Spells and spell-like abilities require that you throw a physrep to indicate their effect. Spell packets are bean-bags that are larger than the human eye socket; approx. 1.5 inches in diameter. They must be filled with biodegradable material that is NOT birdseed or rice and tied or sewn shut. We recommend filling spacets with biodegradable airsoft pellets. 
Clothing, Capes, Shields, and Weapons are all legal targets for spell packets.

**Prohibited weapons**

- Semi-automatic & automatic foam dart guns 

- High capacity High capacity foam dart guns that load more than 6 darts 

- Bows & packet archery We do not allow real bows and boffer arrows. Boffer bows and packet archery are also not allowed. You may use a foam dart gun that simulates the design of a bow or crossbow.
